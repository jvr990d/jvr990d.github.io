                <li> <strong>Contrast: </strong> This site has great contrast the background color is white, while the images and text are bright colors like orange, blue and black. </li>
                <li> <strong>Repetion: </strong> FedEx makes great use of repetion in that to the right of every image has its own description with a header, paragraph, and finally a link. </li>
                <li> <strong>Alignment: </strong>Alignment could use a little work in that everything is really just center align, though this does add a sence of simplicity and oragnaization.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Proximity: </strong> Similar to Repetion they made sure that directly following an image they have an explanation near. </li>

                <li> <strong>Proximity:</strong> No real proxitmity as it all looks like a giant list.  </li>
